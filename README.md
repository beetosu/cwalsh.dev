This is my personal site. it's pretty small, I intentionally made it pretty bare-bones as it mostly just hosts links to other sites and a quick blurb about me.

The one cool bit about it is that it's a [progressive web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)! This means it can be downloaded as a standalone application (including on phones!), caches important files, and can be viewed offline.
This is mostly overkill, but it was a cool learning experience, and forces some good habits (like creating a manifest)
