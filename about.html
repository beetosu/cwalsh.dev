    <h2><a href="resume.pdf">(here's my resume)</a></h2>
    <p>Some quick facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>üêÇ I'm a junior at University at Buffalo, studying Computer Science and English</li>
      <li>üçä I'm a Syracuse native</li>
      <li>üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà I go by they/them pronouns</li>
      <li>üßë‚Äçüíª I've been coding for the better part of the decade</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My initial work was in game development and web design, where I learned (oftentimes the hard way)
      the fundamentals of quality software development, and how to make standout work that feels intuitive
      and leaves a lasting impression on the user.<br><br>
      My current professional interest is focused on frontend, and full-stack development.<br>
      Through group projects in hackathons and college courses, as well as personal projects,
      I believe I have proven myself to be an excellent collaborator,
      who is adaptable to any working environment, or toolset present in a codebase.<br><br>
      I also have experience as an educator and mentor, working as both a
      Teaching Assistant for the introductory Computer Science course at UB, as well as a
      peer mentor for freshmen new to the Computer Science department. Through this, I have cultivated
      an ability to explain tough, technical concepts to people of all levels of technical
      backgrounds, as well as a love for helping people become the best versions of themselves.<br><br>
      Outside of computer science, I'm a big fan of movies, music, and comics. Feel free to check
      out my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/beetosu/">Letterboxd</a> account for the occasional movie hot take.
      If you also want to watch me try (and fail) to make playlists, here's my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/beetosu">Spotify</a>.<br><br>
      I'm open to all kinds of work, in all kinds of fields, so if you want to contact me regarding any opportunies (or you just wanna say hi),
      I check my email <a href="mailto:cpwalsh@buffalo.edu">(cpwalsh@buffalo.edu)</a> often.
